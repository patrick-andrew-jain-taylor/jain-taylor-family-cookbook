> Serve with Frank's Red Hot!

[^1]: A dutch oven is perfect for this recipe.
[^2]: Linguica Seasoning & Portuguese All Spice are optional, but add an extra spicy, sweet, and sour element. If you do use these spices, use sparingly; no more than a tablespoon's worth each.
[^3]: May need to add liquid until rice is done.
