2. Heat the cream, milk, and garlic in a large pan on medium heat.
3. Add the potatoes, bring to a boil, then simmer for 10-15 minutes on low heat.[^2]
4. Drain the potatoes over a bowl to save the milky liquid.
5. Spread the potatoes onto a tray in a thin layer to cool.
6. Heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan.
7. Add the onions and cook on a low heat until soft, translucent, and lightly caramelized.[^3]
8. Remove from heat, and place into a bowl to cool.
9. Chill both the potatoes and onions until needed.

### Puff Pastry Instructions

1. Remove from package, and leave at room temperature for the amount of time listed on the packaging.
2. Lightly flour a work surface, and roll out one sheet until 3mm thick, and if desired, cut out a 26cm-diameter disk.
3. Place the disk on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
4. Roll out the second sheet of pastry into a slightly larger shape, and if desired, cut out a 28cm-diameter disk. Set aside.

### Assembly Instructions

1. Assemble as follows: layer of potatoes, layer of salt & pepper, layer of onions, sprinkle of nutmeg.
2. Ensure to leave a 2cm border around the edge.
3. Brush the pastry border, then lay the larger pastry over the filling.
4. Press the edges to seal, then brush the top with eggwash.
5. Scallop the base by using your index finger to push down on the edge of the pastry and the finger and thumb of your other hand to pinch the pastry either side.
6. Raise the edges using a small knife at right angles, making small indentations around the base.
7. Brush the top with more eggwash.

### Baking Instructions

2. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until pastry is golden and crisp.

### Cheese Sauce Instructions

1. Melt butter in a small pan on medium heat.
2. Add flour and stir to start a roux.
3. Cook on low heat for 2-3 minutes, then gradually add the milky liquid saved from the potatoes.
4. Add roquefort and tarragon, and season to taste with pepper[^4].

Remote the baked pithivier from the oven, and leave to cool before serving with sauce on top!

[^1]: This may be at your local grocery store; if not, substitute any strong bleu cheese!
[^2]: We found we needed extra milk around 10 minutes in; you want a milky consistency for the potatoes.
[^3]: This can take anywhere from 10-20 minutes, depending on your desired level of caramelization.
[^4]: This shouldn't need salt, but more can be added if needed.
