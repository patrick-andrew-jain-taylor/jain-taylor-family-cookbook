## Instructions

1. Put all ingredients in blender or food processor, and blend until just broken down and integrated. This should take no more than 20 seconds.

* A 10" pizza will use a little more than 1/3 cup of sauce, and this recipe wil make about 10 pizzas, depending on how much sauce you like.
