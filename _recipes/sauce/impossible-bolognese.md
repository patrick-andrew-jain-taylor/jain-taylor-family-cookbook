A vegetarian twist on an Italian staple!

## Ingredients

| Ingredients | Quantity |
|:-:|:-:|
| Impossible Meat | 12 oz (340 g) Package |
| Yellow Onion | 2 Small / 1 Medium |
| Carrots | 2 Large |
| Garlic | 4 Cloves / 2 Tsp Jarred |
| Whole Peeled Tomatoes | 28 oz (794 g) Can |
| White Wine (Dry)[^1] | 1/2 Cup |

## Miscellaneous

* Dutch Oven or Heavy Bottomed Pot
* Wooden Spoon
* Salt & Pepper to Taste

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil on medium heat until shimmering.
2. Dice all veggies and add to oil with some salt & pepper. Cook until softened, 6-8 minutes.
3. Lower heat to medium-low and add Impossible meat, italian seasoning, kosher salt, and black pepper. Cook until lightly browned liquid is released. To avoid sticking, add part of the 1/2 cup of white wine as you go, and scrape with a wooden spoon.
4. Add remaining white wine to fully deglaze the oven/pot, and let the sauce simmer until reduced, 1 minute.
5. Lower heat to low and add can of whole peeled tomatoes, breaking up the tomatoes with your hands before dropping into the oven/pot. Break up further with a wooden spoon. Add additional salt & pepper to taste.
6. Cover oven/pot with a lid, and let the sauce simmer until slightly thickened, around 20 minutes. Check & stir every 5 minutes to ensure incorporation of tomatoes & juices.
7. Let the sauce sit until ready to eat. Best served warm.

[^1]: Wine should be acidic, not sweet. Pinot Grigio is recommended, but I've also used Chardonnay in a pinch.
[^2]: Tomatoes can be broken up ahead of time, especially if you don't want juice splattering everywhere...
