A colorful way to use every bell pepper under the sun in your vegetable drawer.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
|:-:|:-:|
| Paneer | 400 g / 2 Cups, Frozen |
| Red Bell Pepper | 1 |
| Orange Bell Pepper | 1 |
| Yellow Bell Pepper | 1 |
| Green Bell Pepper (Capsicum) | 1 |
| Yellow Onion | 1 Medium |
| Red Onion | 1 Medium |
| Tomatoes | 1 14.5 oz Can, Diced[^1] |
| Ginger Garlic Paste | 2 Teaspoons |
| Green Chillis | 2 |
| Oil | 3 Tablespoons |
| Salt | To Taste |
| Black Pepper | 1 Tablespoon |
| Red Chilli Powder | 1 Tablespoon |
| Turmeric Powder | 1/8 Teaspoon |
| Cumin Seeds (Jeera) | 1 Teaspoon |
| Garam Masala | 1 Teaspoon |
| Asafoetida | Pinch |
| Lime Juice | To Taste |

## Instructions

1. Heat oil on medium heat with cumin seeds. Heat until the seeds begin to move around ("dance") in the oil.
2. Add pinch of asafoetida and 1 teaspoon of garam masala. Mix until the spices are thick from the oil.
3. Add yellow & red onions, and combine with thick spiced oil.
4. Reduce heat to low, and cook until onions are brown. This takes about 10 minutes, but stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
5. Add salt & peppers, then mix.[^2]
6. Add ginger garlic paste, then mix.
7. Add canned tomatoes (with liquid!), then mix.
8. Add black pepper, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and lime juice, then mix.
9. Continue to cook on low heat until peppers are soft. This takes about another 10 minutes, but stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
10. Add frozen paneer, and turn heat to medium low for 5 minutes.
11. Turn heat back to low, and cook for an additional 5 minutes to reduce most of the remaining liquid.
12. Serve hot, with either roti (we prefer Methi) or paratha.

[^1]: Keep the liquid for deglaze.
[^2]: From here on in, add salt to taste. There should be lots of sodium from the canned tomatoes alone, but let your taste buds be your guide.
