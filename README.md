These recipes have been collected from both the Taylor family and the Jain family, a combination of shared knowledge passed down between generations, as well as modifications on some modern recipes.

The goal of this project is to maintain these recipes using source control, so tweaks and adjustments can be made without losing the history of what made them so delicious!

We hope you enjoy, and feel free to request updates to some of these recipes, or contribute recipes of your own, using the Github link at the top of the page.

Bon Appetit!
