## Ingredients
* [Pizza Dough](../dough/pizza.md)
* [Pizza Sauce](../sauce/pizza.md)
* [Pizza Cheese Blend](../cheese/pizza.md)
* Olive Oil
* Pizza Stone(s)
* (Optional) 10" Baking Pan(s)

## Instructions

1. Prep [pizza dough](../dough/pizza.md) until doubled in size. Keep covered with plastic wrap.
2. Grease baking pans with 2 teaspoons of olive oil. We recommend [Lloyd Pans](https://lloydpans.com/), but you can also use a plate if you do not have pans.
3. Flatten dough into a circle, but do not over knead. Let them proof for either 1/2 hour in the warm oven, or let them rise at room temperature for about an hour.
    - If you have more patience than me, let them rise longer. This will make for a stretchier dough.
4. After proofing, flatten the dough with your hands, and make rows of tiny holes with your fingernails. This will result in a golf ball effect.
5. Preheat the oven to 500F in convection mode with pizza stone(s) laid on racks for roughly 1 hour.
    - We've done it as quick as 30 minutes 
    - It takes about an hour to make sure the stone is uniformly heated.
6. Prep [pizza sauce](../sauce/pizza.md) in a blender or food processor. 
    - If pre-prepped and frozen, let it thaw in the fridge for 4 hours, or submerge in a cold bath for 90 minutes. Bring to room temperature if possible.
7. Add a little more than 1/3 cup of sauce on the pizza, and spread with ladle in a circular motion.
    - You want sauce around the edge of the pizza to achieve burnt edges.
8. Add handfuls of [pizza cheese blend](../cheese/pizza.md) on top of the sauce.
    - To ensure uniformity, tap the edges while rotating the pans.
9. Add desired toppings.
    - Onions are EXTREMELY recommended, they pair perfectly with the sauce/cheese combo.
    - So far we have had mushrooms and jalape√±os, and they are also delicious.
10. Once oven is preheated, place pan(s) on pizza stone(s) and bake for between 12-14 minutes.
    - This will depend on your individual oven, as our oven reduces convection down to 475 and takes 13 minutes for a perfect pizza.
11. Remove pizza from pan and check bottom for a golden brown color. If needed, place the pizza directly onto the stone for 2 more minutes.
