|     Ingredient    |           Quantity          |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------:|
|    Bread Flour    |       3 1/2 to 4 Cups       |
|       Sugar       |          1 Teaspoon         |
| Instant Dry Yeast |          1 Envelope         |
|    Kosher Salt    |         2 Teaspoons         |
|       Water       |          1 1/2 Cups         |
|     Olive Oil     | 2 Tablespoons + 2 Teaspoons |

* I have also found an equal mix of bread and all-purpose flour to work, but it makes a chewier crust.
* To get your water to 110F, heat room temp water in the microwave for about 40 seconds, or cold water for 60 seconds.
    - This is critical to the fermintation process, do not eyeball it!
    - If you don't have an infrared thermometer handy, you can use a meat thermometer.

## Instructions

1. Combine bread flour, sugar, yeast, and kosher salt in stand mixer. 
2. While mixer runs, add water (heated to 110F) and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and beat until the dough forms into a ball.
    - Too sticky? Add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.
    - Too dry? Add water, water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
3. Scrape dough into a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.
4. Grease the mixing bowl with 2 teaspoons of olive oil.
5. Add the dough back into the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and place in a warm area for 60-90 minutes.
    - My trick for a warm area is to turn on your oven to the lowest setting (about 170F) for about 2 minutes, then turn off the oven.
    - Usually you only need 60 minutes for the dough to rise, but YMMV.
